## Hi, my name is Shane.

I make games, pixel art, and music. I'm interested in the aesthetic and storytelling possibilities of software and games. You can find my games [here](https://ricedust.itch.io/). I'm also a SWE student, teach CS as an assistant, and I've worked on some neat web-based generative art experiments that I've published here on GitHub.

## I'm working on

* ðŸšš developing a chaotic, arcade driving game in Unity
* ðŸŒ± building my [portfolio website](ricedust.com)
* ðŸ§  learning how to build web-based multiplayer games with the [Playroom Kit API](https://joinplayroom.com/)
* âš¡ learning how to use and customize Vim

## I've worked with
